# Aim: This file is an example scripts to train a YOLO model
# The config.yaml file, which contains the training and validation dataset, will be used with this script
# Contributor: Jiayue Yang

# create a virtual environment to perform YOLO training and validation
conda create -n environment_name python=3.9
conda activate environment_name

# install ultralytics library
pip install ultralytics

# ensure pyTorch is installed and usable
python
# import and check the torch version, and if cuda is available with it
--> import torch
--> torch.__version__
--> torch.cuda.is_available() == TRUE # expected = TRUE, if not, CUDA can be installed in torch website https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# if everything looks good, and exit and proceed with YOLO training
--> exit()

# Example command to train the model
yolo task=detect mode=train epochs=n data=config.yaml model=pre_trained_model.pt # (to edit) the training epoch, pre-trained model can be found in YOLO ultralytics website
# Example command to predict the labels in image/video files
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt show=True source=.mp4/.jpg

# Note: The complete command and variables of YOLO can be found in https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/.
