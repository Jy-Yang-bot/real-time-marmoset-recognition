# real-time-marmoset-recognition
This program was designed for real-time recognition of different freely moving marmosets, based on unique facial features, using the YOLOv8 algorithms.

Example applications:
- Recognizing freely moving individuals in a common marmoset family.
- Identifying animals in a real-time setting during behavioral experiments.
- Measuring the duration of animal presence within a designed experimental space.
